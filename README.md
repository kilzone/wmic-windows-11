# WMIC on Windows 11
'Old' Windows 10 WMIC files to create an hybrid (frankenbuild) Windows 11 environment to enable old tooling again (like NodeJS packages relying on WMIC to get system information).

## Installation
1. Download desired release from releases
2. Unpack files onto your Windows drive - folder structure already present

# Note
WMIC is deprecated - developers should move to the new PowerShell WMI commands - this is only for (advanced) users that want to use (older) packages on the new Windows 11. I'll respond to any question asked, but cannot change Microsoft's decision to remove this feature from Windows 11.
